# Demo.AspNetCore.JqGrid

This demo application shows how jqGrid can be used in ASP.NET Core (with help of [Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid](https://github.com/tpeczek/Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid)).

Packages for Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid are available on NuGet.

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tpeczek).
